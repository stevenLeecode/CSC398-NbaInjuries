Tasks

1. Merge injuries and player totals datasets
2. Once merged, perform data cleaning (remove nan values)
3. Add extra column in Dataframe to see if player is injured or not
 (int = 1 if injured, int = 0 if not injured.)
4. Add another column to categorize type of injury (torn muscle, achilles, sprain)
5. For the step above, do research how would we do this? Parse Notes column and do Regex?
